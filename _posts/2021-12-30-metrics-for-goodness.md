# Metrics for Goodness
Over the course of life, we redefine our measures of goodness from strictly moral, inherited rule systems to balanced applications of ethics with intention to gradually incorporating social and environmental choices.  We revere heroes who exemplify our metrics for goodness.  This process parallels our development in accepting our impact on society and our environment.

## An evolution of heroes and metrics
As we evolve with experience and exposure to fresh ideas on goodness, our admiration for heroes from younger days wane as we search for more sophisticated representative models.  Moralistic examples like superheroes, firefighters, and nurses appeal for their self-sacrifice and following traditional mores.  There are clear, unambiguous lines where primary goodness is preventing death and suffering.

Heroes that struggle against the tide to take a harder path toward goodness, like making way for an unseen path such as a nonviolent answer start to take on a subtle, even more powerful effect.  The everyman that supports the hero through kindness becomes more of a starring role.  These heroes break expectation, going against the rules to find a better outcome for all.  They are examples of actors who value ethics over morals.

Those that question ethics themselves, such as philosophers, atheists who turn against religion, charitable volunteers, and effective altruists appeal thereafter.  The question of goodness evolves beyond maximizing utilitartian goodness or what is goodness or hypotheticals.  Ethical systems and consistency becomes the focus of attention.

After this, those that choose environments which can maximize good opportunities become heroic.  This returns to the moralistic heroes, but they are seen as good because they choose situations where they can maximize their goodness to others.  They also choose to remove themselves from situations where they are presented with only bad choices.  There's a new empathy for villains who could not remove themselves from those situations, and a new respect for all the previous hero archetypes for making new paths for goodness.

## A parallel to development
In many ways, this process parallels maturation.  As we begin life, we assume we can impact the whole world, not knowing its scope.  We see present, momentary impact as most pressing.  We admire those that know more than us, are stronger than us, and are able to perform feats of courage.  We absorb society's moral expectations without criticism.

We accept the ambiguity of everyday life, realizing that opportunities for goodness are rarely so pure and simplistic as the moral guidelines handed to us.  We accept that we need to look for our own ethics and the consequences of our own choices in terms of goodness toward others and ourselves.

In our search for ethics, we face the bitter reality that charlatans obscure immoral and unethical behaviors behind false pretenses.  We recognize and accept the personal responsiblity in choosing sources to accept into our metrics for goodness.

In seeking a self-consistent ethical system, we realize that society is a chaotic system, full of contradiction an independent actors.  We accept control of our own lives and choices, seeing ourselves as single actors in this complex system.

## Nostalgia
When discussing heroes, there is an inevitable nostalgia.  There's not only a nostalgia for the hero, but also for the boundless hope of your childhood, where saving the whole world felt possible with a fly-by by Superman.  You could dream of becoming a firefighter, and the hope was that if you became one, you could save the whole world with your sacrifice.

Now, we know that there's no superhero who could end all of the world's contradictory needs.  It's a complex system where agency and freedom are essential.  Still, we all grieve that yearning for the power to affect more lives and a simple solution from time to time.
